# Vasya likes the number 239. Therefore, he considers a number pretty if its last digit is 2, 3 or 9. Vasya wants to watch the numbers between L and R (both inclusive), so he asked you to determine how many pretty numbers are in this range. Can you help him?
# Input
# The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
# The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers L and R.
# Output
# For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the number of pretty numbers between L and R.
# Sample Input 1 
# 1 10
# 11 33
