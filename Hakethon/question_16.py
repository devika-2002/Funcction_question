# 15. Add Two Numbers
# You are given two  lists representing two non-negative integers. The most significant digit comes first and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.
# You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
 
# Example 1:

# Input: l1 = [7,2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
# Output: [7,8,0,7]

# Example 2:
# Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
# Output: [8,0,7]

# Example 3:
# Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
# Output: [0]



list1 = ["Shogun","Tapioca Express","Burger King","KFC"]
list2 = ["Piatti","The Grill at Torrey Pines","Hungry Hunter Steakhouse","Shogun"]
# Output: ["Shogun"]
i=0
while i<list1:
    if list2=="Shogun":
        print("Shogun")
    i=i+1
